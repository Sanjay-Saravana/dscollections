# dscollections Overview

`dscollections` provides a broad suite of practical DSA implementations with professional packaging and documentation.

## What is included

- Linear structures: dynamic arrays, stack, queue, deque, circular queue, singly/doubly linked lists.
- Trees: binary search tree with multiple traversals.
- Graphs: directed/undirected adjacency-list graph with BFS and DFS.
- Heaps: min-heap, max-heap, and priority queue.
- Hash structures: hash map and hash set.
- Advanced structures: trie and disjoint set union (union-find).

## Usability goal

Each structure has a readable string representation so calling `print()` on an instance shows meaningful internal contents.
